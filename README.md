# KidsPaint
KidsPaint is a simple drawing app for kids (and parents!) built for macOS &amp; iPadOS that lets you:
Draw with brushes
Add big, fun stickers
Change colors and sizes
Open a photo and draw on top of it
Save your artwork as a PNG image
There are no documents to manage and no confusing menus. Just draw and save.

The Main Tools (Top Toolbar)
At the top of the window you’ll see four tool buttons:
🖌 Brush
Draw freely on the canvas.
Use the Size slider in the bottom bar to make lines thicker or thinner.
Use the Color bar to change the drawing color.
🧽 Eraser
Works just like the brush, but erases instead of drawing.
Size controls how wide the eraser is.

✨ Stickers
Lets you place big, colorful stickers.
Choose a sticker from the sticker strip at the bottom.
Click anywhere on the canvas to place it.
Stickers can be moved, resized, rotated, and deleted.

🎨 Bottom Control Bar (Kid-Friendly Controls)
